# Results: Comparison of Machine Learning Approaches for NetworkGWAS

## Overview

We evaluated three different machine learning approaches for phenotype prediction using network-aggregated genomic data: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Random Forest, and XGBoost. All models were trained on the same dataset with 117 features derived from gene neighborhood aggregation and evaluated using identical protocols.

## Methodology: Detailed Approach Explanations

### 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Approach

**Conceptual Foundation:**
Convolutional Neural Networks are deep learning models originally designed for image processing but adapted here for 1D genomic data. The CNN treats the aggregated SNP features as a sequential signal, applying convolutional filters to detect local patterns and relationships.

**Architecture Details:**

- **Input Layer**: 117 network-aggregated SNP features treated as a 1D sequence
- **Convolutional Blocks**: Two sequential blocks with increasing filter complexity
  - Block 1: 32 filters with kernel size 5 and 3, batch normalization, ReLU activation
  - Block 2: 64 filters with kernel size 3, batch normalization, ReLU activation
- **Regularization**: Multiple dropout layers (0.2-0.5) and batch normalization for overfitting prevention
- **Pooling**: MaxPool1d for dimensionality reduction
- **Global Pooling**: Adaptive average pooling to handle variable input sizes
- **Output**: Fully connected layers (64→32→1) for regression

**Theoretical Advantages:**

- Can capture local genomic patterns and feature interactions
- Hierarchical feature learning through multiple layers
- Translation invariance for detecting patterns regardless of position
- End-to-end learning without manual feature engineering

**Implementation Specifics:**

- 25 training epochs with Adam optimizer (learning rate 0.001, later 0.00025)
- MSE loss function for regression
- Batch size 16 with 80/20 train/test split

### 2. Random Forest Approach

**Conceptual Foundation:**
Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees through bootstrap aggregating (bagging). Each tree is trained on a random subset of both samples and features, and predictions are averaged across all trees.

**Algorithm Details:**

- **Ensemble Size**: 200 decision trees for robust predictions
- **Feature Sampling**: √n features sampled per tree (where n=117)
- **Bootstrap Sampling**: Each tree trained on random sample with replacement
- **Tree Construction**:
  - Maximum depth: 10 levels to control overfitting
  - Minimum samples per split: 5 to prevent overfitting
  - Minimum samples per leaf: 2 for regularization
- **Prediction**: Average of all tree predictions for regression

**Theoretical Advantages:**

- Reduces overfitting through ensemble averaging
- Handles non-linear relationships naturally
- Provides feature importance rankings based on impurity reduction
- Robust to outliers and missing data
- No assumptions about data distribution
- Parallelizable training across trees

**Genomic Data Suitability:**

- Excellent for high-dimensional genomic data
- Can capture complex gene-gene interactions
- Feature importance helps identify key genomic regions
- Handles mixed SNP encoding (0, 1, 2) effectively

### 3. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) Approach

**Conceptual Foundation:**
XGBoost is an advanced gradient boosting framework that sequentially builds decision trees, where each new tree corrects errors made by previous trees. It uses gradient descent optimization to minimize prediction errors.

**Algorithm Details:**

- **Boosting Strategy**: Sequential tree construction with error correction
- **Tree Parameters**:
  - 200 estimators (boosting rounds)
  - Maximum depth: 6 levels for complexity control
  - Learning rate: 0.1 for balanced convergence
- **Regularization**:
  - L1 regularization (alpha=0.1) for feature selection
  - L2 regularization (lambda=1.0) for coefficient shrinkage
  - Subsampling: 80% of rows and columns per tree
- **Optimization**: Second-order gradient information for faster convergence

**Advanced Features:**

- **Built-in regularization**: Prevents overfitting better than basic gradient boosting
- **Feature importance**: Multiple metrics (gain, frequency, coverage)
- **Missing value handling**: Automatic optimal direction learning
- **Scalability**: Efficient memory usage and parallel processing

**Theoretical Advantages:**

- Superior predictive performance on tabular data
- Automatic feature interaction detection
- Built-in cross-validation and early stopping capabilities
- Handles heterogeneous data types effectively
- Strong mathematical foundation with second-order optimization

**Genomic Data Optimization:**

- Excellent for SNP-phenotype association discovery
- Handles population stratification through regularization
- Can model epistatic interactions between genetic variants
- Robust to noise in genomic measurements
